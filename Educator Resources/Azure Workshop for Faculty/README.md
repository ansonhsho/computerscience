# Microsoft Azure Skills Workshop for Faculty
Welcome to Microsoft Azure Workshop Content Repo, explore Azure (cloud computing services) and it's Artificial Intelligence capabilities.

This repo will help you navigate Azure and identify the Azure services to enable data science in your research or classroom. What AI solutions and services are offered by Azure? How do I stream data from a device? How do I store different types of data? How can I extract information from across multiple documents and databases? How do I get the processing power I need for compute intense activities?

To complete the workshops you will require an Azure subscription. Follow the instructions [here](AzureSignUpPersonalAccount.md) to activate your Azure subscription and credits.

#### Using Custom Vision
Azure Custom Vision is a cognitive service that lets you build, deploy, and improve your own image classifiers. An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to determine the labels to apply.

### IoT through IoT Hub
IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages. You can use Azure IoT Hub to build IoT solutions with reliable and secure communications between millions of IoT devices and a cloud-hosted solution backend. You can connect virtually any device to IoT Hub.

### Train your own model using Microsoft Azure Notebooks
Microsoft Azure Notebooks are the implementation of Jupyter Notebooks on Azure. A Jupyter Notebook allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more. Jupyter supports many different programming languages. On Azure Notebooks we currently support Python 2 and 3, F#, and R.
